### I Array Sorting(5/5)

- #### Sorting/Quicksort/MergeSort
Describe worst time and space complexity.

- #### Counting Sort/ Selection Sort
Describe worst time and space complexity

- #### heapSort
Implement heap sort algorithm.

- #### mergeSort
Implement merge sort algorithm.

- #### quickSort
Implement quick sort algorithm.

### II Dynamic programming/Greedy Algo/Math(15/3)

- #### 509. Fibonacci Number
Implement function getFibonacciNumber(N). Describe time and space complexity.

- ####  153. Find Minimum|Maximum in Rotated Sorted Array.
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

- #### 69. Sqrt(x) 
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

### III Stack/Queue(4/4)

- #### Implement two stacks in one array
A [1 . . n] in such a way that neither stack overflows unless
the total number of elements in both stacks together is n. The PUSH and POP operations should runin O(1) time.

- #### Stack insertion and deletion
Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a deque (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1)-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque constructed from an array.

- #### Implement a queue using two stacks.
Analyze the running time of the queue operations.

- #### Show how to implement a stack using two queues.
Analyze the running time of the stack operations.
